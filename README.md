Searching for global news has never been made more fun and interactive! Interact with Map to easily find the recent news in any country! It is the fastest way to see what's going on! Hello world!

Our project simplifies and makes the process of finding global news more interactive! Rather than pouring news article after article, the user can instead choose where they want to see the news from. This is done by interacting with the map. After selecting a country, and clicking the button to find local articles, the most recent news articles occurring in the selected country are presented to the user. Users can press the arrow buttons to browse other articles found. The randomimzer button of them will drop the users location somewhere on the map.
